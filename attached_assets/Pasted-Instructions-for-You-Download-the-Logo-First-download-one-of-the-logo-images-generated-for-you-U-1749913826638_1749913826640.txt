Prompt for Replit Assistant
Hello! Please help me integrate my new company logo into my project. I have uploaded the logo file to assets/logo.png.

Here are the tasks:

1. Update the Favicon:

Find the main index.html file (it might be in the root directory, public/, or src/).
In the <head> section, locate the <link rel="icon" ...> tag.
Update its href attribute to point to /assets/logo.png.
If the tag doesn't exist, please add <link rel="icon" href="/assets/logo.png"> to the <head>.
2. Add Logo to the Welcome Banner:

Identify the HTML element that serves as the main welcome banner or hero section. It is likely a <header> or a <div an id="welcome-banner"> or a <section class="hero">.
Insert an <img> tag within this banner to display the logo. The HTML should look something like this: <img src="/assets/logo.png" alt="Company Logo" class="banner-logo">.
In the corresponding CSS file, please add styling for the .banner-logo class to ensure it's displayed correctly. A good starting point would be:
CSS

.banner-logo {
  height: 50px; /* or a suitable size */
  width: auto;
  margin-right: 15px; /* Adjust as needed */
}
3. Update Progressive Web App (PWA) Icons:

Check for a manifest.json or manifest.webmanifest file in the project.
If it exists, find the icons array inside it.
Update the src path for each icon entry to point to /assets/logo.png. You can use the same path for all specified sizes for now.
Please apply these changes. If you are uncertain about any of the file paths or element selectors, let me know.
